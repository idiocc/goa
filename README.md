# @goa/koa

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40goa%2Fkoa.svg)](https://npmjs.org/package/@goa/koa)

`@goa/koa` is the [Koa web-sever](https://koajs.com) compiled and optimised with _Google Closure Compiler_ so that it has 0 dependencies. The types are written as JSDoc and don't require installing typings. The aim of this project is to demonstrate how to modernise the old-school NPM package making, including starting to use import/export statements without _Babel_, restoring to pure _JSDoc_ without TypeScript, and compiling the code into the single executable using the compiler, and testing the code with [_Zoroaster_](https://contexttesting.com) testing framework which is twice as fast and weighs 500KB against 50MB compared with _Jest_ (as used in the original repository).

## Types

The types detailed information can be found [here](doc/TYPES.md). This is a detailed breakdown of type annotations that was used for compilation, therefore it's rather raw because it's meant for generates externs and typedefs for JSDoc. The Koa documentation can be found on its page.
