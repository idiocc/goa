# @goa/koa

%NPM: @goa/koa%

`@goa/koa` is the Koa web-sever compiled and optimised with _Google Closure Compiler_ so that it has 0 dependencies. The types are written as JSDoc and don't require installing typings, therefore they work not just with TypeScript-based editors and don't require downloading additional data.

```sh
yarn add @goa/koa
```
