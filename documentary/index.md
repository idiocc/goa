# @goa/koa

%NPM: @goa/koa%

`@goa/koa` is the [Koa web-sever](https://koajs.com) compiled and optimised with _Google Closure Compiler_ so that it has 0 dependencies. The types are written as JSDoc and don't require installing typings. The aim of this project is to demonstrate how to modernise the old-school NPM package making, including starting to use import/export statements without _Babel_, restoring to pure _JSDoc_ without TypeScript, and compiling the code into the single executable using the compiler, and testing the code with _Zoroaster_ testing framework that is twice as fast and weighs 500KB against 50MB compared with _Jest_ which is used in the original repository.

<!-- therefore they work not just with TypeScript-based editors and don't require downloading additional data. -->

```sh
yarn add @goa/koa
